# BBC Sounds CLI

As outlined here https://www.hifiwigwam.com/forum/threads/high-quality-320kbps-streams-for-all-bbc-radio-stations.82711/ - whilst BBC usually broadcasts digitally at 128kbps - it does offer high quality 320kbps streams.

These m3u8 files can be used to access the high quality streams - however don't contain any metadata about the songs being played. So I decided to write a simple CLI which would make use of both.

I was originally planning to use beautiful soup to scrape the data from the HTML - however found that there was additional metadata hidden in the JavaScript, so wrote a horrible function to find it.

One complication was that BBC Sounds only shows live metadata for users who are logged in so. The script will work fine without any credentials - though for totally up-to-date metadata a valid email & password for your BBC account should be set via the `BBC_SOUNDS_EMAIL` & `BBC_SOUNDS_PASSWORD` env vars.

(Warning - this code is ðŸ—‘ - I don't write code like this for work ðŸ˜„)
